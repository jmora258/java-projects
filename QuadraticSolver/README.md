# QuadraticSolver 

<h2>Description</h2> <br> 
This simple Java program solves a quadratic equation using
Newton's method (Newton-Raphson Method), an iterative procedure
for finding a root (zero) of a function. 
<strong>Functionality:</strong><br> 
<ul><li>finds one of the roots of your equation starting from
your initial guess (must be hard-coded).</li> 
<li>for a better approximation to the actual root, adjust 
the tolerance variable (larger number: more accurate)</li></ul> 


<h2>How to Run Java Programs from the Command Prompt</h2> 
<strong>First: </strong> 
If you are using a Windows machine, make sure to install JDK and add it to the system path. <br> 

<strong>Second: </strong><br> 
Select Start -> Computer -> System Properties -> Advanced system settings <br/> 
-> Environment Variables -> System variables -> PATH

<strong>Third: </strong><br> 
Prepend <em>C:\Program Files\Java\version_number\bin;</em> to the beginning of the <br>
PATH variable (where version_number is the version of your JDK). 

To find the version of your system's JDK, launch the command prompt and type: <br> 
    <em>java -version</em>  

EXAMPLE: <br> 
    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_40\bin;

<strong>Fourth: </strong><br> 
Use these commands:<br>  
	TO COMPILE:  <em>javac NameOfClass.java</em><br> 
	TO EXECUTE:  <em>java NameOfClass</em>
