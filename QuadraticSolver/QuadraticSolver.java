 * Project Name: 	Quadratic Solver
 * Description: 	This simple Java program solves a quadratic equation using
 *					Newton's method (Newton-Raphson Method), an iterative procedure
 *					for finding a root (zero) of a function. 
 *					Functionality: 
 * 						- finds one of the roots of your equation starting from
 * 							your initial guess (must be hard-coded). 
 * 						- for a better approximation to the actual root, adjust 
 * 							the tolerance variable (larger number: more accurate)

        // NOTE: in this program: 
        //  f(x) is represented by       f 
        // f'(x) is represented by      dfdx
