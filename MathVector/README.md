# MathVector 

<h3>MathVector is a class for N-dimensional mathematical (Euclidean) vectors.</h3> 

<strong>MathVector Consists of the Following:</strong><br><br> 

<strong>Instance Varables:</strong> 
<ul><li>a variable representing the dimension of the vector</li> 
<ul><li>a variable holding the Cartesian components of the vector</li></ul>
<br> 
<strong>Methods</strong>

<ul><li>getEl – returns the i-th Cartesian component of the vector</li> 
<li>neg – returns the negative of the original vector</li> 
<li>mag – returns the magnitude of the vector</li> 
<li>dot – returns the dot product of the vector and another vector</li> 
<li>plus – returns the sum of the vector and another vector</li> 
<li>sp – returns the product of the vector and a scalar (“scalar product”)</li> 
<li>printMe – prints the elements of the vector, like “[1, 0, 0]”</li></ul>

<strong>Constructors</strong>
<ul><li>a constructor that accepts only the dimension of the vector as input and constructs a zero vector with that dimension</li> 
<li>a constructor that accepts the Cartesian components of the vector as input</li><ul>
